Add required VSCode extensions:

* "x86 and x86_64 Assembly" by 13xforever
* "Hex Editor" by Microsoft

Add required dev tools:

* FASM = Flat Assembler
* NASM = Netwide Assembler (https://nasm.us)
* QEMU = Quick Emulator

```
sudo apt install fasm nasm qemu
```
You don't need both fasm & nasm but having them both might be useful in the future.
